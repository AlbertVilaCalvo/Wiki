From the book 'Amazon Web Services in Action' (Manning):

> GCP is focused on developers looking to build sophisticated distributed systems.

> GCP seems more focused on cloud-native applications than on migrating your locally hosted applications to the cloud.

> One of GCP’s most differentiated features has been their multi-region and global services like Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, and Cloud KMS. These let you operate on the same resources in multiple regions, giving you more resilience to an outage in a single region. As a bonus, Google’s multi-region services often come with strong consistency across regions so customers don’t have to deal with consistency at the application layer.

> In contrast, most AWS services are region oriented, and when AWS provides multi-region services like DynamoDB Global Tables and S3 Cross-Region Replication, you need to handle eventual consistency yourself.
