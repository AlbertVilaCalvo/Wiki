When you buy a domain it creates a hosted zone for you:

> To make it easier for you to use Route 53 as the DNS service for your new domain, we'll automatically create a hosted zone. That's where you store information about how to route traffic for your domain, for example, to an Amazon EC2 instance. If you won't use your domain right now, you can delete the hosted zone. If you will use your domain, Route 53 charges for the hosted zone and for the DNS queries that we receive for your domain. For more information, see [Amazon Route 53 Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/).
