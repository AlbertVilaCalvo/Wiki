# S3 - Simple Storage Service

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home or https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home

You cannot delete an S3 bucket containing objects. You need to empty it first.

## S3 use cases

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zc16KhOILM

1. Backups (eg database backups)
   - We can set rules to delete objects that are no longer needed, eg delete database backups older than 7 days
   - We can have versions of the same file
2. [Static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html)
   - Note that "Amazon S3 website endpoints do not support HTTPS. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3"
3. Share files to logged/authorized users with [presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html). URLs expire
4. Long term archiving
   - For files that are accessed infrequently, but need to be saved for years
   - There are various [storage classes/tiers](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/): Standard-Infrequent Access, Glacier...
5. Compliance with regulations
   - Eg comply with the GDPR by storing data at the EU, set encryption etc.
6. FTP server
7. Application cache
8. Upload files
   - Since we are not uploading to our server, we don't need to worry about CPU, bandwidth or availability
9. Query data and perform analytics with [Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/), which allows to query data in S3 using SQL
10. S3 triggers/events, eg to fire a lambda functions
11. Partial data access with [S3 Select](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/selecting-content-from-objects.html), which allows to retrieve a subset of a file instead of the whole file

## Hosting a static website

Hosting a static website using Amazon S3 - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html

> Amazon S3 website endpoints do not support HTTPS. If you want to use HTTPS, you can use Amazon CloudFront to serve a static website hosted on Amazon S3. For more information, see [How do I use CloudFront to serve HTTPS requests for my Amazon S3 bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3) To use HTTPS with a custom domain, see [Configuring a static website using a custom domain registered with Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html).

## Hosting a static website with S3 and CloudFront - manually

### Steps

Create a **S3 bucket**. Go to the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com) and click Buckets -> Create bucket. Set the bucket name. Everything else should be at the default value:

- 'Object Ownership': check 'ACLs disabled (recommended)'.
- 'Block Public Access settings for this bucket': check 'Block all public access' since the user will access the content through CloudFront. Most tutorials tell you to uncheck all checkboxes (ie make all S3 content public) but it's not required.
- 'Bucket Versioning' -> Disable.
- 'Default encryption' -> Disable.
- Advanced settings
  - 'Object Lock' -> Disable.

Create a **CloudFront distribution**. Go to the [CloudFront console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) and click 'Create a CloudFront distribution'. (The article [How do I use CloudFront to serve HTTPS requests for my Amazon S3 bucket?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-https-requests-s3/) talks about this.)

- At 'Origin domain' select the one you've just created at S3. Should be something like `<s3-bucket-name>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`.
- Make the S3 bucket private by setting 'Origin access' to 'Origin access control settings (recommended)'. This "limits the S3 bucket access to only authenticated requests from CloudFront". See [Restricting access to an Amazon S3 origin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html). Origin access control (OAC) is recommended over origin access identity (OAI).
  - Click 'Create control setting'. At the dialog that opens, leave 'Sign requests (recommended)' checked and click 'Create'.
  - Note that "You must update the S3 bucket policy. CloudFront will provide you with the policy statement after creating the distribution."
- Set 'Viewer protocol policy' to 'Redirect HTTP to HTTPS".
- Set 'Default root object' to `index.html`.
- Click 'Create distribution'.

We need to update the S3 **bucket policy**. A blue banner says "Complete distribution configuration by allowing read access to CloudFront origin access control in your policy statement.". Copy the policy from the banner. It's something like:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::the-s3-bucket-name/*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::564627046728:distribution/Q5H1J6OCBE3KIO"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

To update the bucket policy, go to the S3 bucket -> Permissions and paste the policy JSON to the 'Bucket policy' textarea.

Note that there's _no_ need to [configure the bucket as static website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html).

To upload files to the S3 bucket do: `aws s3 sync <build-folder> s3://<s3-bucket-name> [--profile <profile>]`. Files should now appear on the S3 console, at the Objects tab.

You should now be able to visit the CloudFront URL (aka the 'Distribution domain name', something like https://d1p1ex8s7fge20.cloudfront.net) with your browser and see the site live :)

Every time we update the S3 bucket content we need to invalidate the CloudFront edge caches to replace the files. Either use the command `aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <distribution-id> --paths '/*' [--profile <profile>]`, or do this at the console.

### Fix 403 Forbidden error for SPA

If you have a SPA (eg a React app created with CRA) and you visit `xyz.cloudfront.net/about` and refresh, it will not work - will say 'AccessDenied' with response code 403.

To fix this, at the CloudFront distribution, set a custom error response at the Error pages tab with this values:

- HTTP error code: 403 Forbidden.
- Error caching minimum TTL: something like 60 seconds? Default is 10.
  - Is the "The minimum amount of time that you want CloudFront to cache error responses from your origin server (ie S3)" [source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesErrorPages).
  - Also see [Controlling how long CloudFront caches errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/GeneratingCustomErrorResponses.html#custom-error-pages-expiration).
- Customize error response: Yes.
  - Response page path: `/index.html` (must begin with `/`).
  - HTTP Response code: 200 OK.

Then perform an invalidation to the path `/*`.
