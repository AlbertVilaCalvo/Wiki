## Run a single job

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency

Example from https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/68abeab3718d5d2d5f224103b807c547467e27f3/pages/static.yml#L18-L21 that ensures only one GitHub pages concurrent deployment:

```yml
# Allow only one concurrent deployment
concurrency:
  group: 'pages'
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

## Run only if a folder or file has changed

Use the `paths` filter:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    paths:
      - src/**
      - package.json
```

See [Patterns to match file paths](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#patterns-to-match-file-paths) for how to write the paths.

Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore

Run job only when a folder changes - https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25669

There's also `paths-ignore` that instead excludes.

Note that "You cannot use both the `paths` and `paths-ignore` filters for the same event in a workflow", but you can use `!` to negate/exclude and achieve the same.

## Change directory

Use `working-directory`, eg:

```yml
# If you use 'defaults' it applies to all 'run' steps in a workflow
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: web
```
