:::tip
If you want to make a process asynchronous, you must manage the way the process initiator tracks the process status. One way of doing that is to return an ID to the initiator that can be used to look up the process. During the process, this ID is passed from step to step. (AWS in Action p. 401.)

When designing an asynchronous process, itâ€™s important to keep track of the process. You need some kind of identifier for it. (AWS in Action p. 441.)

Loose coupling benefit: reduce interdependencies so a failure in one component does not cascade to other components.
