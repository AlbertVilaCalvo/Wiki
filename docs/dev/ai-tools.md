Prompt engineering for GitHub Copilot Chat - https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/prompting/prompt-engineering

> First give Copilot a broad description of the goal or scenario. Then list any specific requirements.

> Use examples to help Copilot understand what you want. You can provide example input data, example outputs, and example implementations.
>
> Unit tests can also serve as examples. Before writing your function, you can use Copilot to write unit tests for the function. Then, you can ask Copilot to write a function described by those unit tests.

> If you want Copilot to complete a complex or large task, break the task into multiple simple, small tasks.

> Avoid ambiguous terms. Instead, be specific. What does the `createUser` function do? What does the code in your last response do?

> If you want to use a specific library, set the import statements at the top of the file or specify what library you want to use.

> To get suggestions as you code, open any relevant files and close irrelevant files. Copilot will use the open files to understand your request.
>
> Open the file or highlight the code that you want Copilot to reference. You can also use keywords to manually supply context to Copilot Chat. For example, you can add the `@workspace` chat participant in VS Code, or `@project` in JetBrains IDEs.

> If you don’t get the result that you want, iterate on your prompt and try again.
>
> You can delete the suggestion entirely and start over. Or you can keep the suggestion and request modifications.
>
> You can reference the previous response in your next request. Or, you can delete the previous response and start over.

> Copilot Chat uses the chat history to get context about your request. To give Copilot only the relevant history:
>
> - Use threads to start a new conversation for a new task
> - Delete requests that are no longer relevant or that didn’t give you the desired result

> Make sure that your existing code follows best practices and is easy to read.
