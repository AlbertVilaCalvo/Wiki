## copilot-debug

From https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_96#_debugging-with-copilot

Use it by prefixing the command that you would normally run with `copilot-debug`. For example, if you normally run your program using the command `python foo.py`, you can now run `copilot-debug python foo.py` to start a debugging session.

## `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

Personal instructions take the highest priority, followed by repository instructions, with organization instructions prioritized last. However, all sets of relevant instructions are still combined and provided to Copilot Chat.
