title: Service control policies (SCPs)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps.html

Control what API actions are allowed in a given account, that is, the maximum available permissions in an AWS account. SCPs do not grant permissions.

IAM policies apply at users and roles within an AWS account, but SCP apply to multiple accounts or organizations.

:::info
SCP is a limit, not a permission, like permission boundaries.
