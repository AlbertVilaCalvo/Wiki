Everything in AWS is an API call.

## Things to do when you create an AWS account

With the root user.

- Enable MFA for the root user [link](/aws/iam#root-user-multi-factor-authentication-mfa)
- Set the account alias (at the IAM dashboard)
- Enable IAM access to billing (so that non-root users can have access to billing) [link](/aws/billing-pricing#enable-iam-access-to-billing)
- Enable free tier alerts [link](/aws/billing-pricing#enable-free-tier-alerts)
- Enable CloudWatch billing alerts and create one or more budgets [link](/aws/billing-pricing#create-budget-and-enable-cloudwatch-billing-alarmalert)
- Create the first IAM admin user [link](/aws/iam#create-the-first-iam-admin-user)
  - Once the admin is created, enable MFA for it
- Enforce MFA to users [link](/aws/iam#enforce-mfa-to-users)
