:::info
**Everything in AWS is an API call.** It doesn’t matter whether you are using the management console, the command line interface or writing code using an SDK — you are always interacting with an API.

AWS is API driven. You can automate everything. Automation increases reliability and efficiency.

APIs is one of the reasons why AWS has been so successful.

## Global Infrastructure

https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/

AWS service types (AZ, regional and global) - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/aws-service-types.html

From AWS in Action page 388, complemented with [AWS Services by Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services) and [AWS service types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/aws-service-types.html):

- Some services are global, like IAM, Organizations, CDN (CloudFront), DNS (Route 53), Global Accelerator, Direct Connect, Firewall Manager, WAF and Shield. STS has a single global endpoint and multiple regional endpoints ([source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/announcing-upcoming-changes-to-the-aws-security-token-service-global-endpoint/)). See [Global services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/global-services.html).
- Some services operate over multiple availability zones within a region, like S3, EFS, SQS and DynamoDB. They can withstand an availability zone outage by default. See [Regional services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/regional-services.html).
- Some services can optionally fail over into another availability zone, like RDS with [Multi-AZ](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/features/multi-az/), and EC2 with [Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/).

Also see which servies are fault tolerant at page 433.

Overview:

- 36 regions
- 114 availability zones
- 700 CloudFront PoP and edge locations + 13 regional edge caches
- 42 local zones (metropolitan areas)
- 29 wavelength zones (telco)
- 135 Direct Connect locations

### Regions

Regions are isolated and independent geographic locations. Regions are connected by the AWS global network. All regions currently have three or more Availability Zones.

Most services are region-specific, except for IAM, CDN (CloudFront) and DNS (Route 53), which are global ([more info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68811957/aws-global-services)). Note that at the web console, when you go to the IAM Dashboard, the region at the navigation bar is "Global" and you can't select any region like "N. Virginia".

Regions are independent; data isn't transferred between regions. AWS charges you for data transferred between regions.

Not all services are available on all regions, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services, [AWS Service Availability Tool](https://awsservices.info) and [AWS Services Matrix](https://services.adlinga.com/services).

:::info
For **disaster recovery**, deploy across multiple **regions**.
For **high availability**, deploy across multiple **availability zones** for redundancy and quickly fail over to another AZ.
:::

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/regions.html

> AWS believes that most customers can achieve their resilience goals in a single Region by using Regional services or Multi-AZ architectures that rely on zonal services. However, some workloads may require additional redundancy, and you can use the isolation of AWS Regions to create Multi-Region architectures for HA or business continuity purposes. (...) However, achieving the benefits of a Multi-Region architecture can be difficult; it requires careful work to take advantage of Regional isolation while not undoing anything at the application level. For example, if you’re failing over an application between Regions, you need to maintain strict separation between your application stacks in each Region, be aware of all the application dependencies, and failover all parts of the application together. Achieving this with a complex, microservices-based architecture that has many dependencies between applications requires planning and coordination amongst many engineering and business teams.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/regional-services.html

> Regional services are services that AWS has built on top of multiple Availability Zones so that customers don’t have to figure out how to make the best use of zonal services. We logically group together the service deployed across multiple Availability Zones to present a single Regional endpoint to customers. Amazon SQS and Amazon DynamoDB are examples of Regional services. They use the isolation and redundancy of Availability Zones to minimize infrastructure failure as a category of availability and durability risk. Amazon S3, for example, spreads requests and data across multiple Availability Zones and is designed to automatically recover from the failure of an Availability Zone. However, you only interact with the Regional endpoint of the service.

### Availability zones

:::warning
AWS charges $0.01/GB for network traffic between availability zones. See [Overview of Data Transfer Costs for Common Architectures](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/) and [Data Transfer within the same AWS Region](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer_within_the_same_AWS_Region).

Note that you pay twice: for outbound and inbound traffic. From [The hidden cross AZ cost: how we reduced AWS Data Transfer cost by 80%](https://medium.com/@debyroth340/the-hidden-cross-az-cost-how-we-reduced-aws-data-transfer-cost-by-80-836b6d06886d):

> Effectively, it’s 0.02$ per GB since each transferred gigabyte counted as 2GB on the bill: once for sending and second for receiving.

See [Understanding AWS Network Traffic Costs](https://aws.plainenglish.io/understanding-aws-network-traffic-costs-8e95542e1d84) for more network costs.

Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html

A region consist of (typically) 3 or more availability zones, located in the same area but isolated and physically separate from each other. Each availability zone consist of one or more data centers — we don’t know how many because AWS doesn’t make information about their data centers publicly available.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/availability-zones.html

> An Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers with separate and redundant power infrastructure, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. Availability Zones in a Region are meaningfully distant from each other, up to 60 miles (~100 km) to prevent correlated failures, but close enough to use synchronous replication with single-digit millisecond latency. They are designed not to be simultaneously impacted by a shared fate scenario like utility power, water disruption, fiber isolation, earthquakes, fires, tornadoes, or floods. Common points of failure, like generators and cooling equipment, are not shared across Availability Zones and are designed to be supplied by different power substations.

> All Availability Zones in a Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber.

To distribute resources across availability zones, when creating an AWS account, AWS randomly maps AZ identifiers (eg eu-west-1a) to different AZ data centers (eg use1-az4) for each account. You can see this mapping at the VPC console, at the Subnets page, at the columns "Availability Zone" and "Availability Zone ID". You can check that the mapping is different for different accounts by running `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --region eu-west-1 --profile <profile>` with two different profiles, and you may get this different responses:

```json
{
  "RegionName": "eu-west-1",
  "ZoneName": "eu-west-1a",
  "ZoneId": "euw1-az1"
}
```

```json
{
  "RegionName": "eu-west-1",
  "ZoneName": "eu-west-1a",
  "ZoneId": "euw1-az2"
}
```

### Local zones

Run resources in dense metropolitan areas, close to the users.

## Things to do when you create an AWS account

With the root user.

- Enable MFA for the root user [link](/aws/root-user#multi-factor-authentication-mfa)
- Set the account alias (at the IAM dashboard). It's easier to remember than the account id
  - Note that the account alias must be globally unique, since it's used to generate the sign-in URL (eg `https://albert.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`). It can be changed later.
  - Do not confuse the account alias with the account name, which is defined when you create the AWS account, and it helps you identify the account. The account name can also be changed.
- Enable IAM access to billing (so that non-root users can have access to billing) [link](/aws/billing-pricing#enable-iam-access-to-billing)
- Enable PDF invoices delivery by email [link](/aws/billing-pricing#enable-pdf-invoices-delivery-by-email)
- Enable free tier alerts [link](/aws/billing-pricing#enable-free-tier-alerts)
- Enable CloudWatch billing alerts and create one or more budgets [link](/aws/billing-pricing#create-budget-and-enable-cloudwatch-billing-alarmalert)
- Create the first IAM admin user [link](/aws/iam#create-the-first-iam-admin-user)
  - Once the admin is created, enable MFA for it using the root account [link](/aws/iam#add-mfa-to-other-users)
- Enforce MFA to users [link](/aws/iam#enforce-mfa-to-users)
- Set an account password policy [link](/aws/iam#password-policy)
- At the S3 dashboard, at the "Block Public Access settings for this account" page, enable "Block _all_ public access" to disable public access for _all_ S3 buckets in the account [link](/aws/s3#block-all-public-access-for-all-buckets-in-the-account)
- Enable regions that are not enabled by default, eg "Europe (Spain)". This is done by clicking Account at the top right

## Tags

Tagging enables customers to group sets of resources for cost reporting and automation, such as patching for select tagged instances and grouping resources that make up a microservice, application, or workload.

## Multiple accounts

TODO move this to a new doc?

With multiple accounts you can isolate resources, for example development and production resources.

For disaster recovery, it's also recommended to place the duplicated workloads in separate accounts. See [Designing for multi-account scenarios using AWS Disaster Recovery Service](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/designing-for-multi-account-scenarios-using-aws-disaster-recovery-service/)
