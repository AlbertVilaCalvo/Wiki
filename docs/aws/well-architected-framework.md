## General Design Principles

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/general-design-principles.html

- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days

## Operational Excellence

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/oe-design-principles.html

The ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operations, and to continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.

Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Security

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec-design.html

How to take advantage of cloud technologies to protect data, systems, and assets in a way that can improve your security posture.

## Reliability

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/rel-dp.html

The ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.

## Performance Efficiency

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/perf-dp.html

The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

## Cost Optimization

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/cost-dp.html

The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

## Sustainability

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sus-design-principles.html

The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
