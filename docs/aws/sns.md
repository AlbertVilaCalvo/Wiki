> Amazon SNS is a messaging service that supports Application-to-Application (A2A) communication. The A2A functionality provides topics for high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. Amazon SNS Standard topics provide best-effort ordering and at-least-once-delivery, while Amazon SNS FIFO topics support strict ordering and exactly-once delivery. Both Standard and FIFO topics support message filtering and fanout to multiple subscriptions, with high durability and security.

> Amazon SNS is recommended when you want to build an application that reacts to high throughput or low latency messages published by other applications or microservices (as Amazon SNS provides nearly unlimited throughput), or for applications that need very high fan-out (thousands or millions of endpoints). Messages are unstructured and can be in any format.

Messages can be delivered to SQS queues, email addresses, mobile apps (push notifications), phone numbers (SMS text messages), Lambda functions, HTTP(S) endpoints (webhooks) and Kinesis Data Firehose streams. These are called endpoints.
