> Whatâ€™s the simplest way to run containers on AWS? My first relevant container workload was running on a fleet of EC2 instances managed by ECS. Maintaining and scaling the needed EC2 instances was wasting a lot of my time. So I got very excited when AWS announced Fargate, a managed compute layer for ECS. Deploying a web application with ECS and Fargate felt quite simple to me. But then, I discovered App Runner, which adds another layer of abstraction and lifts the developer experience to a new level.
