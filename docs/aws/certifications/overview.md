Uses a scaled scoring. See [Demystifying your AWS Certification exam score](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/demystifying-your-aws-certification-exam-score/).

> Since this is a scaled score, the 836 does not mean that the candidate answered 83.6 percent of the questions correctly.

Do the Solutions Architect Professional before doing a Specialty. Professional is harder than Specialty because of the breadth.
