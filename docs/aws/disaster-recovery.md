REL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data loss - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/rel_planning_for_recovery_objective_defined_recovery.html

RTO: recovery time objective. Maximum downtime. How long it takes to restore the system.

RPO: recovery point objective. Maximum data loss. Time of the latest backup.

Live data means the data stores and databases are up-to-date (or nearly up-to-date) with the active Region and ready to service read operations.

- Active/passive: only one site gets traffic. When a disaster occurs, the requests are routed to the passive site.
- Active/active: both sites get traffic.

### Backup and restore

Backups are done to another region for safety.

The infrastructure is rebuilt manually, which takes hours.

### Pilot light

Basic infrastructure elements are in place, like Elastic Load Balancing and EC2 Auto Scaling, but services are "shut off" (ie no EC2 instances are running).

It cannot serve requests until triggered.

### Warm standby

Maintains a minimum deployment that can handle requests, but at a reduced capacityâ€”it cannot handle production-level traffic. We have a few EC2 instances running only.

Before failover, the infrastructure must scale up to meet production needs.

### Multi site active/active

Both sites serve traffic.

## Application Recovery Controller

Move traffic across Regions or away from Availability Zones.
