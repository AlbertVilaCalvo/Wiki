Set up a multi-account environment based on best practices.

It automatically sets up AWS Organizations.

When you set up the landing zone, it creates:

- A management account and a Root OU that sits at the top of the organization hierarchy.
- 2 organizational units:
  - Security OU. Foundational. Required. Contains the Log Archive account and Audit account, known as shared accounts.
  - Sandbox OU. Additional. For the accounts you create, like dev and prod.
- 3 shared accounts: the management account, the Log Archive account and the Audit account.
- IAM Identity Center directory to manage users.
- Preventive guardrails and detective guardrails.
- Organization-level CloudTrail trail to aggregate logs for all accounts in the AWS Organization. Events are stored in an S3 bucket.
- Permissions that Control Tower needs to administer accounts and SCPs in the organization. For example, the roles AWSControlTowerAdmin, AWSControlTowerStackSetRole, AWSControlTowerCloudTrailRole and AWSControlTowerConfigAggregatorRoleForOrganizations.
