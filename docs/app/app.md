- From the apk itself with `keytool -list -printcert -jarfile <my-apk-file.apk>`

Once you have the SHA-1 you need to convert it to base64. There are various ways:

- `node -e 'console.log(Buffer.from(process.argv[1].split(":").map(hex => parseInt(hex, 16))).toString("base64"))' 'PASTE_YOUR_SHA1_HERE'`
