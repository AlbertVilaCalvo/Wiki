_Do not pay the full price of the exam, there are always discounts at the Linux Foundation and other places._

When you pay for the exam you get to _two_ attempts.

## Tips

Delete objects using the `--now` flag to avoid having to unnecessarily wait for the grace period to end.

## KCNA - Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate

https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/kcna/

https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate

A light version of the CKA. Multiple-choice questions, theoretical.

> A pre-professional certification designed for candidates interested in advancing to the professional level...

## KCSA - Kubernetes and Cloud Native Security Associate

https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/kcsa/

https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-and-cloud-native-security-associate-kcsa

A light version of the CKS. Multiple-choice questions, theoretical. Not easy, requires some knowledge.

## CKA - Certified Kubernetes Administrator

https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/cka/

https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka

Focuses on infrastructure. For sysadmins. Much harder than the KCNA.

Only covers on-prem Kubernetes clusters, no cloud provider Kubernetes environments.

Hands-on. The CKA (and the CKAD and CKS too) exam environment does not offer a UI for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. You can only use `kubectl` and other command line-based tools.

Must have taken and passed the CKA exam prior to attempting the CKS exam. The hardest.
