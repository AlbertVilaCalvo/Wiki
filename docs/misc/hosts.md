## Error ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'

If an error like "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'lxml'" is thrown when running `updateHostsFile.py`, then install the required dependencies by following [Generate your own unified hosts file](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts#generate-your-own-unified-hosts-file).

Basically run `pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt`.
