Storage engine for modern hardware - https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb/ - From Thoughworks Technology Radar 27:

> OrioleDB is a new storage engine for PostgreSQL. Our teams use PostgreSQL a lot, but its
> storage engine was originally designed for hard drives. Although there are several options to tune
> for modern hardware, it can be difficult and cumbersome to achieve optimal results. OrioleDB
> addresses these challenges by implementing a cloud-native storage engine with explicit support
> for solid-state drives (SSDs) and nonvolatile random-access memory (NVRAM)...
